# What is Action Factory?
Action Factory is an AI tool designed to provide solutions for the user's prompts. The specialty of this AI tool is in its ability to create it's own tools to help solve a problem.
Action Factory follows a "chain-based" system, following stages of research, production, and testing for debugging purposes.
